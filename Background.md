## 1. The Policy Problem

Nova Scotia is at a critical juncture regarding its public health mandates and healthcare delivery capabilities. As of January 2026, the "Need a Family Practice Registry" reports that approximately 66,768 Nova Scotians remain unattached to a primary care provider. For the pediatric population, this "attachment gap" is not merely a matter of convenience; it is a direct barrier to disease prevention.

Historically, childhood immunizations have been primarily delivered through family physician offices. However, as the physician shortage persists, many children—particularly those entering pre-primary and primary school—lack a consistent "medical home" where their immunization records are tracked and their doses are administered on schedule. Recent 2024-2025 data indicates that while first-dose measles coverage for two-year-olds is high (93.4%), the completion rate for the second dose falls to 78.6%. This sits significantly below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity, leaving the province vulnerable to outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and pertussis.

## 2. Strategic Tensions

The Director of Public Health faces a choice between two delivery models, each with distinct trade-offs:

Public Health Mobile Units (PHMU): This is a centralized, high-control model. PHMUs are effective at targeting high-risk geographic "hotspots" and ensuring high-quality data entry directly into provincial systems. However, they are resource-intensive, requiring specialized nursing staff who are already in short supply across the province.

Pharmacy-Led Pediatric Program: This is a decentralized, high-access model. Leveraging Nova Scotia’s 300+ community pharmacies would dramatically increase the number of "doors" open to parents. However, current regulations and training (such as the Pediatric Injections Training Program) must be standardized, and a sustainable funding model for pharmacists must be established to handle infants and toddlers, a group typically outside their routine immunization scope.

## 3. Key Stakeholders

Nova Scotia Health (NSH) Public Health Leadership: Responsible for meeting provincial coverage targets and managing the healthcare budget.

Parents of "Unattached" Children: The primary users who face logistical barriers (transportation, work hours) when seeking vaccines without a family doctor.

Community Pharmacists: Potential frontline providers who require specialized training, legal authority, and fair compensation to expand their scope of practice.

Department of Education and Early Childhood Development: Relies on Public Health to enforce the Immunization of School Pupils Act to prevent school-based outbreaks.

## 4. Data Plan

To inform the decision, this project will analyze the following data sources:

Nova Scotia Open Data: School-Based Immunization Coverage Reports to identify zones with the highest gaps.

NSH Registry Reports: Need a Family Practice monthly updates to correlate physician shortages with low-vaccination clusters.

CIHI Health Indicators: Comparative data on pediatric access to primary care across Atlantic Canada.
