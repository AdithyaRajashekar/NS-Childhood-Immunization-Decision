# Closing the Immunization Gap: Strategic Resource Allocation for Unattached Pediatric Populations in Nova Scotia.

## The decesion 

Should Nova Scotia Health prioritize the expansion of Public Health Mobile Units or establish a specialized Pharmacy-Led Pediatric Vaccine Program to close the immunization gap for unattached children?

## Summary

Nova Scotia is currently facing a critical challenge in maintaining herd immunity for its youngest residents. While provincial policy requires proof of immunization for school entry, the delivery of these vaccines has historically relied on primary care providers (family doctors and nurse practitioners). However, as of early 2026, over 65,000 Nova Scotians remain on the Need a Family Practice Registry. This "primary care gap" has directly contributed to a decline in childhood immunization coverage; recent data indicates that while over 93% of two-year-olds have received their first measles dose, only 78.6% are fully vaccinated with both required shots—significantly below the national safety target of 95%.

This project provides a decision-support analysis for the Director of Public Health at Nova Scotia Health (NSH). The Director must decide how to best allocate limited provincial resources to reach these "unattached" pediatric populations before they enter the school system. The analysis evaluates two primary strategic paths:

Expanding Public Health Mobile Units (PHMUs): A direct-delivery model that brings NSH nurses into underserved rural and urban zones.

Standardizing a Pharmacy-Led Pediatric Program: A community-integrated model that leverages the province’s existing network of 300+ pharmacies to administer routine childhood injections beyond the traditional flu and COVID-19 scope.

Through a combination of systems thinking and data analysis, this portfolio explores the trade-offs between these two options. It considers constraints such as the current nursing shortage, the legislative pressures of Bill 210, and the geographic disparities in vaccine access across the four health zones. Ultimately, this work aims to provide a data-driven recommendation on which model offers the most sustainable and scalable solution to close the immunization gap and protect Nova Scotia’s communities from preventable outbreaks.
